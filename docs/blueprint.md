# **App Name**: Manga Static Reader

## Core Features:

- Directory Listing: Dynamically lists available manga titles by reading directory names from a designated folder.
- Manga Viewer: Displays the manga pages (images) from a directory in a sequential, reader-friendly layout.
- Chapter Navigation: Navigation allows users to easily go to the next or previous page/chapter of the manga.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft Purple (#B19CD9) to create a calm and immersive reading environment. This choice steps away from conventional manga site aesthetics, aiming for a sophisticated yet accessible feel.
- Background color: Light Lavender (#F5EEF8), providing a gentle contrast with the text and images without causing eye strain. This keeps the focus on the manga content itself.
- Accent color: Deep Plum (#673AB7) for interactive elements like buttons and progress bars, offering clear visual cues and a touch of elegance.
- Clean and readable sans-serif font to ensure comfortable reading on all devices. Optimized for both headings and body text to maintain clarity and improve the overall reading experience.
- Simple, monochrome icons for navigation and controls. These icons should be universally recognizable, enhancing usability without distracting from the manga content.
- Clean and intuitive layout with a focus on maximizing screen real estate for manga pages. Minimalist design with a sidebar navigation, so users focus on reading and navigation is straightforward and accessible.
- Smooth transitions for page turning and chapter loading. Avoids jarring effects that could detract from the reading experience.
